[CoCalc](https://cocalc.com) wants you to fully accomplish your computational work online.
To archive this goal,
CoCals has to provide a reliable service, offer and maintain the software you need, and package this in a powerful interface.

The new **"Assistant"** is one of the latest additions to the interface.
Its goal is to help you by offering a **curated set of annotated code snippets**.

<div style="text-align: center;">

    style="width:80%"

</div>


Open it from within a Sage Worksheet or Jupyter Notebook.

<div style="text-align: center">
<i>Sage Worksheets</i>
<br/>
<img
    src="{{ '/img/assistant/assistant-sagews.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}"
    style="width:50%;"
>
</div>

<br/>

<div style="text-align: center">
<i>Jupyter Notebooks</i>
<br/>
<img
    src="{{ '/img/assistant/assistant-jupyter.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}"
    style="width:50%;"
>
</div>

You can browse through the categories, explore the collected functionalities,
or search for certain keywords.

One click, and it inserts the selected code snippet with an accompanying description right where you are in your document.
Then, you can _inspect_, _modify_ and _learn_ from the example right in front of you.

All the code examples are available at [github.com/sagemathinc/cocalc-assistant](https://github.com/sagemathinc/cocalc-assistant) and we're happy to receive contributions.
