I just released a new SageMathCloud feature -- **TimeTravel Diffs**

In a supported document, open up "TimeTravel", click on "changes", drag sliders, and see what changed in a file during any interval.  This works for all editor based documents, e.g., python code, sage worksheets, etc.  (Not available for Jupyter notebooks yet.)   You can see exactly what happened with a file during any interval of time.
