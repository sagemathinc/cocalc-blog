Our Nightly Changelog keeps you updated on small feature changes, bugfixes, and quality of life improvements. For upcoming changes, see our weekly progress report column.

### General Usage
- Added recent activity avatars for collaborators to the file listing page for every project. Clicking one takes you to the file that person viewed last in the project. [#848](https://github.com/sagemathinc/smc/pull/848)

### Quality of Life
- In the Course Manager, replaced "_student not found_" with "_student already in course_" where appropriate to prevent confusion when adding students. [#851](https://github.com/sagemathinc/smc/issues/851).
