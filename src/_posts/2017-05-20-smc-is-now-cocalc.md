As of May 20, 2017, SageMathCloud is being renamed to __CoCalc__, for __Collaborative Calculation in the Cloud__.

## A Natural Evolution

SageMathCloud was introduced in April 2013 as a hosted platform for the SageMath software system. It saved thousands of users the time and effort of building, installing, and updating SageMath locally. SageMathCloud provided a single consistent platform for improving the range and quality of services offered.

Over time, we began adding new features, mostly for our own needs: a course manager to teach students SageMath, chat to coordinate within the platform, a $\LaTeX$ editor to write documents, and Jupyter notebooks to support fellow instructors. In addition to conventional backups, we added snapshots and time travel. We added support for numerous languages, including Python 3 as well as Python 2, R (including R markdown), the complete Anaconda distribution, Octave, Julia, C, C++, Haskell, and Scala. We included major libraries and packages for these languages, and update them regularly.

We became a platform that enables students, teachers, and researchers to collaborate using a broad selection of programming languages and development tools -- not just SageMath.

While SageMathCloud suggests exactly what we started out as, we have certainly outgrown it.
The new name, CoCalc, reflects the evolution into a  general purpose, cloud-based calculation and computation platform.
Our recent move to rewrite the Jupyter notebook to be more integrated and fully supported is an example of how our mentality has shifted.

## The CoCalc Experience

Newcomers can explore CoCalc services from different approaches:

- Projects. In CoCalc, work happens inside _projects_. A project is a personal workspace where you can group related files.

- Collaboration. By inviting collaboraters into your project, you allow them to see and chat about your work, and even edit it with you in real time.

- Teaching. With Cocalc's teaching tools, you can setup courses, create handouts with mathematical formulas, and manage homework and grading.

- Authoring. CoCalc has extensive support for $\LaTeX$, in document editing as well as all interactive notebooks and chat.

## What Should I Do If I'm Already an SMC Subscriber?

When you visit https://cloud.sagemath.com after the change, you’ll be immediately redirected to https://cocalc.com. You’ll then have to sign in again the first time. That will set a cookie, and after that everything will be as normal. Anyone following a link into the old name, e.g. `https://cloud.sagemath.com/some_path...`, will be redirected to the same path under the new name, `https://cocalc.com/some_path...`.

You will notice our documentation changing to use the CoCalc product name and the CoCalc.com domain name.

We have created a new CoCalc discussion group in Google Groups <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cocalc">here</a> and we will automatically subscribe all current sage-cloud subscribers to it.

## What Stays the Same

The company behind CoCalc will remain SageMath, Inc. Our staff email addresses will remain in the `sagemath.com` domain.

More importantly, we remain committed as ever to improving the experience of scientific and exploratory computing for students, teachers, and researchers around the world.
