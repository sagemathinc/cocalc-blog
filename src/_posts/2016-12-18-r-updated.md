Dear R users!

We've switched our default R to be the "official" one from [https://www.r-project.org/](https://www.r-project.org/).
Therefore the default R version has been updated from version 3.2.4 to the most recent one 3.3.2.

This is a quite significant update from the one in SageMath, hence this notice. You still want to work with the older one in SageMath, though:

1. In the command-line use `R-sage` instead of `R` and `Rscript-sage` instead of `Rscript`.

2. In Jupyter notebooks there are two R kernels: the newer "R (R-Project)" and "R (SageMath)" for the version shipped with SageMath.

Regarding libraries, we did install all the ones we know about and many more. In total, there are 557 R libraries (1.3 gb) available. Still something missing? Email [help@sagemath.com](mailto:help@sagemath.com).
