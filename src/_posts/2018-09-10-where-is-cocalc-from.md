#### Meet the team and company that provides CoCalc.

## CoCalc Origins

Prior to CoCalc, William Stein spent 15 years teaching and doing research using mathematical software at Berkeley, Harvard, UCSD, and Univ of Washington.  Based on this experience, he launched the [CoCalc web application](https://cocalc.com) in April 2013, under the name SageMathCloud, with the mission **to make it very
easy to collaboratively use free open source
mathematics and data science software in classes and research**.

After over 5 years of extremely active development, CoCalc
is now a modern web application that provides
collaborative access to most free open source
technical software, including LaTeX, Jupyter Notebooks,
the Python numerical ecosystem, the R statistics software, and SageMath.
Thus CoCalc brings together the work of thousands
of contributors to open source software under one
roof, which is easily accessible from your web
browser.


## The Company

Sagemath Inc., the company behind CoCalc, is an independent Seattle based tech startup founded by William Stein in Feb 2015.  The
mission of SageMath, Inc. is to **be a
sustainable company whose interests are
strongly aligned with
the open source mathematical software community**.

SageMath, Inc. provides new sources of support
for open source mathematics software, by contributing to those projects
and making them more accessible.
Though SageMath, Inc. continues to grow substantially,
it does not seek venture capital investment and will
not be purchased by a large tech company. The
company has greatly benefited from support by
sophisticated investors with a love of mathematics.
(If you would like to be such an investor, please
[contact us](contact@sagemath.com).)

## Who We Are

There are currently four people--William, Harald, John, and Hal--who work fulltime on CoCalc (though many others have contributed to CoCalc):

Past significant contributors include: Greg Bard, Rob Beezer, Keith Clawson, Tim Clemans, Andy Huchala, Jon Lee, Simon Luu, Nicholas Ruhland, Travis Scholl, and Todd Zimmerman.

Much of CoCalc is open source.
Anyone can review the code (and offer pull requests!)
[on GitHub](https://github.com/sagemathinc/cocalc).

## Where CoCalc Runs

The [public CoCalc.com web application](https://cocalc.com)
often has over [5000 active users a day](https://share.cocalc.com/share/7561f68d-3d97-4530-b97e-68af2fb4ed13/stats.html) served via a scalable and battle tested architecture built on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) and deployed
on Google Cloud Platform.
This scalable backend is proprietary;
contact us at [help@sagemath.com](mailto:help@sagemath.com) if you are interested in running it on your infrastructure.

There is also a free and open source [CoCalc Docker image](https://github.com/sagemathinc/cocalc/wiki/CoCalc-Docker-Image), suitable for easily running your own private
CoCalc server on your computer.
This image, currently about 10 GB, does not contain all the nearly 300 GB of open-source software available
at [https://cocalc.com](https://cocalc.com).
However, it fully supports collaboratively running Jupyter, Python, SageMath, R, Julia, Octave, and editing LaTeX documents.
