Last week marks the end of the summer and we noticed a significant increase in overall traffic and activity.
This adds more pressure to the ongoing [Kubernetes]() rewrite of the SMC back-end.
We also started to collect a few courses [teaching with SMC](https://github.com/sagemathinc/smc/wiki/Teaching) &mdash; if you are also teaching with SMC, please [let us know](mailto:teaching@sagemath.com)!
