Why use SageMath instead of Mathematica or Maple?  
It's 2018. Programming isn't restricted to software developers at tech companies anymore.
Anyone in a scientific field will have to run simulations, do computations, or analyze data.
Where will your calculus, linear algebra, and diff-eq students end up?
Probably not mathematics research.

All the conveniences of Mathematica as a language are all detriments to your students should they use
almost anything outside Computer Algebra Systems.

Learning about a general purpose programming language like Python is far more beneficial
than a niche higher level language like Mathematica. Moreover, Mathematica has all sorts of quirks that make it interesting to transition to general purpose languages.
For example functions are invoked with square brackets `[]` instead of parentheses `()` and lists use curly brackets
`{}` which would designate a set or map in other languages.

To set their students up for success where they'll end up, it's time for mathematical software to catch up with
scientific computing and technology. Learning things which build on open source, general purpose tools 

Students need to be skilled at using software and technology that the will make them more effective in the future.
"It's more important for the student to know how make the computer solve a differential equation than [for] them to solve it themselves." (Drew Sutherland)
