# "How is CoCalc's LaTeX editor better than ShareLaTex, Overleaf, etc.?"

## Introduction

I just did a [Google search for online latex editor](https://www.google.com/search?q=online+latex+editor).

The first page of results includes [the LaTeX editor for
CoCalc that I wrote](https://cocalc.com/doc/latex-editor.html), and several other potential competitors:

* [ShareLaTeX](https://www.sharelatex.com/)
* [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/)
* [LaTeX Base by SciDock](https://latexbase.com/)
* [Online LaTeX Equation Editor - CodeCogs](https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php)
* [Online Latex Editor - Tutorialspoint](https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php)
* [Papeeria: online LaTeX editor](https://papeeria.com/)
* [Host Math - Online LaTeX formula editor...](http://www.hostmath.com/)
* [Interactive LaTeX Editor - Arachnoid](https://arachnoid.com/latex/)
* [Online Latex Equation Editor - Sciweavers](http://www.sciweavers.org/free-online-latex-equation-editor)

I'm curious about how [CoCalc's](https://cocalc.com) LaTeX editor compares to each of these. CoCalc provides all open source mathematics software in
a single polished and robust web application, which includes chat, many people can edit files simultaneously (like with Google Docs),
and there is a Linux terminal and full featured course management system. A major difference between CoCalc and all of the other web applications mentioned above, is that they are focused specifically
on editing LaTeX, whereas in CoCalc LaTeX editing as one of
many features in a more general platform.

I'm not going to pay money to write the comparisons below. I'm just going to create an account and try out editing files in each. I'll
edit a tiny file, a medium file, and a large file. Note that CoCalc
does not remove functionality at all for non-paying customers, except
(1) the Docker container running a free CoCalc project may not
create outgoing network connections, and (2) publicly shared files
are "unlisted", so they won't be indexed by Google. Both limits are purely to avoid abuse.

**DISCLAIMER:** Please do not consider this an objective comparison or review of online latex editors! I'm the lead developer of CoCalc, after all! I make no claim whatsoever to be objective. That said, if there is anything factually incorrect as of Aug 5, 2018, please
[let me know](mailto:wstein@sagemath.com).

<!--

there is a wikipedia page about latex editors: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_TeX_editors it has a column where "online" says it is available via the browser.
one that's not mentioned here is https://www.verbosus.com

and well, fun fact, with my new chrome browser (?) I can't even click on their initial create project dialog. well done -_- (more luck in firefox, except for being able to switch between files more easily, it's worse than cocalc. I've no clue why someone would pay ~$5/m for that.)

## [ShareLaTeX](https://www.sharelatex.com/) vs CoCalc

## [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) vs CoCalc

One year ago Overleaf acquired ShareLaTeX and announced
that the two web applications would merge. Last week
I was talking with an overleaf developer, and he said
that the merged version will be released soon, and it
will be called "Overleaf", but
"it is looks much more like ShareLatex than Overleaf".
I did not find out _why_ ShareLaTex was acquired, but
I will speculate that
ShareLaTeX gambled on creating and launching
a product called [DataJoy](https://www.getdatajoy.com/),
whose goal was to "make data analysis with Python and R easier to learn, more accessible and collaborative." They spent several
years and a lot of effort on the product, but shut it down, as
they are ["a small company without external investment"](https://www.getdatajoy.com/.)
They wrote: "DataJoy was a new tool in a space where there are a lot of good options...". One of the "good options" they are referring
to is CoCalc, of course. Some people (e.g., the afformentioned
Overleaf developer I recently talked to) mistakenly take the
failure of DataJoy to mean that there isn't a market for
making data analysis with Python and R more accessible and
collaborative.
