Rough ideas for a blog post on why CoCalc's latex editor is the best.


Compared to ShareLatex:

 - still hasnâ€™t implemented a multi-user-aware undo
 - sharelatex shows only one frame on a doc; no way to split
 - sharelatex charges extra for their change history, and it is not as good as ours
 - sagetex
 - knitr integration
 - disk space
