# A Blog Post about what CoCalc is, in terms of people

Purpose:

 - related to my intro slide for JupyterCon
 - also related to typical questions we would get at MathFest (or answers) about:
    - are we an inflexible large company?
    - a tiny startup
    - how long have we been around?
    - how is uptime?

- Basically we want to paint as clear and honest a picture of the structure of the company (and product) to better build trust with our users.
